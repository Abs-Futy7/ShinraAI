    Analyze the final blog post and extract all marketing claims.
    
    Blog content: {blog_content}
    Product name: {product_name}
    
    Identify:
    1. ✅ SAFE CLAIMS - Statements directly supported by blog content
    2. ⚠️ RISKY CLAIMS - Superlatives ("best", "#1"), guarantees, health/safety claims,

    For each risky claim, suggest safer wording alternatives:
    - "may help" instead of "will solve"
    - "designed to" instead of "guaranteed to"
    - "customers report" instead of "proven to"
    
    Output as JSON:

      "safe_claims": ["claim 1", "claim 2", ...],
      "risky_claims": [
        {{"claim": "original text", "risk_type": "superlative|guarantee|stat|etc", "suggestion": "safer alternative"}}
      ],
      "overall_assessment": "LOW_RISK|MEDIUM_RISK|HIGH_RISK"
